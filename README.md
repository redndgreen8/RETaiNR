## 🎯 Mission

Use AI/ML to predict, prevent, and address participant attrition for longitudinal research studies through intelligent data integration and predictive modeling.

## 📋 Framework Overview

**RETaiNR** follows a systematic approach to participant retention:

- **R**ecruitment → **E**ngagement → **T**racking → **ai** → **N**otification → **R**etention

Our framework transforms traditional participant management into a proactive, data-driven system that anticipates and prevents dropouts before they occur.

## 🏗️ Data Integration Architecture

### Primary Data Sources

#### 🧬 OpenSpecimen LIMS
- **Purpose**: Biospecimen tracking and laboratory data management
- **Integration**: Real-time specimen collection status, processing timelines, and quality metrics
- **Key Metrics**: Collection compliance rates, specimen quality scores, processing delays

#### 📊 REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)
- **Purpose**: Secure, HIPAA-compliant research data management platform
- **Capabilities**:
  - Demographic data capture and management
  - Longitudinal survey data collection and tracking
  - Automated survey deployment and reminder systems
  - Real-time data quality monitoring
- **Key Metrics**: Survey completion rates, response times, data quality scores

#### 🏥 Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive medical history and treatment data integration
- **Data Types**: Clinical visits, treatment adherence, health outcomes, medication compliance
- **Key Metrics**: Appointment attendance, treatment compliance, health status changes

#### 📈 Marketing Analytics
- **Status**: Not currently integrated
- **Future Scope**: Communication effectiveness, engagement channel optimization

## 🤖 Machine Learning Architecture

### Model Selection Strategy

Our ensemble approach combines complementary algorithms to maximize prediction accuracy and reliability:

#### 🌳 Tree-Based Models

##### Random Forest
- **Strengths**:
  - Stable and reliable predictions across diverse datasets
  - Excellent handling of missing data (common in longitudinal studies)
  - Clear feature importance rankings for clinical interpretation
  - Robust to outliers and noise in real-world data
- **Use Case**: Baseline predictions and feature importance analysis

##### Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- **Strengths**:
  - Superior accuracy for complex, non-linear relationships
  - Exceptional at capturing subtle timing patterns in longitudinal data
  - Handles sequential dependencies and temporal features
  - Optimized for large-scale healthcare datasets
- **Use Case**: High-precision predictions and temporal pattern recognition

### 🎯 Ensemble Strategy: Best of Both Worlds

#### Combination Approach
**Weighted Ensemble**: `Random Forest + Gradient Boosting + Additional Models`

#### Key Benefits
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Consistently outperforms individual models
- **Reduced Overfitting**: Multiple model perspectives prevent single-model bias
- **Built-in Uncertainty Estimation**: Model agreement indicates prediction confidence
- **Robust Performance**: Maintains accuracy across different patient populations

#### Clinical Decision Support
- **High Confidence Predictions**: When models agree → automated interventions
- **Manual Review Flagging**: When models disagree → clinical team review
- **Interpretable Results**: Clear feature importance and decision pathways

## 🎯 Primary Prediction Target

### Risk of Missing Next Blood Draw
**Primary Actionable Outcome**: Predicting likelihood of missed appointments/collections

#### Why This Matters
- **Proactive Intervention**: Identify at-risk participants before dropout occurs
- **Resource Optimization**: Focus retention efforts on highest-risk participants
- **Study Integrity**: Maintain statistical power and reduce bias from attrition
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Prevent expensive re-recruitment and protocol deviations

#### Prediction Timeline
- **Short-term**: 1-2 weeks before scheduled collection
- **Medium-term**: 1-3 months ahead for strategic planning
- **Long-term**: Study-wide attrition risk assessment
